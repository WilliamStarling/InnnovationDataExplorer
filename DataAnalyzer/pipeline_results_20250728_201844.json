A recurring observation is the absence of onsite representatives during inspections, though this document did note an onsite representative. This document also highlights the issue of expired permits, even when no current deficiencies are noted, suggesting a need to track permit status alongside compliance. This document specifically details \"Minor Deficiencies\" and provides specific issues like lack of gravel at entry/exit, compromised silt fence, and missing permit/rain gauge.",

# Data Collection
Handled by Kingston Barnes

The purpose of this stage was to collect documents and other data that are relevent to what the user is trying to do. Some websites are frustrating and conufisng to use, and this will ideally help automate that process. It then pacakges them into Attachments objects and returns them for use by the Data Analysis stage.

If I remember my conversation with Kingston currectly, it does this by using BrowserUse to explore the websites in order to download the revelent files.
